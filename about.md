In her day job, Kathryn Jepsen serves as editor-in-chief for a publication about particle physics and astrophysics. In her more mysterious night job, Kathryn works as a developmental editor, helping writers shape their fiction and narrative nonfiction. She offers support to writers of novels, series, flash fiction, short stories, novelettes and novellas.

Kathryn loves reading, baking, and taking any class offered at the local university greenhouse. She earned a master&rsquo;s degree in journalism with a focus on science writing from Northwestern University and a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in journalism with a minor in creative writing from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. She has worked as a Peace Corps Volunteer, English teacher, and journalist. She is constantly adding to her survival skills as the co-leader of her daughter&rsquo;s Girl Scout Troop.
